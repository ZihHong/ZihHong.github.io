       My research integrates spatial statistics, remote sensing, and machine learning to model how urban green infrastructure contributes to residentsâ€™ wellbeing, and to optimally allocate these spaces for enhanced ecosystem services, sustainability, and environmental efficiency. I develop data-driven approaches to evaluate and optimise the environmental performance of cities, contributing to the advancement of sustainable urban development and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
