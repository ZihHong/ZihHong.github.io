abstract: Nature-based Solutions (NbS) play a critical role in enhancing urban resilience and mitigating climate change. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is considered a suitable approach for evaluating NbS environmental efficiency; however, due to DEAâ€™s limitations, the evaluation results may be inconsistent when new NbS are assessed. To address this gap, this study presents an innovative framework that integrates DEA with machine learning (ML) to evaluate and predict the efficiency of NbS. This approach offers decision-makers a scalable and adaptable tool to enhance multiple ecosystem services in a cost-effective manner. This study uses potential NbS locations in the Taipei River Basin as a case study. Various tree-based boosting classification algorithms were tested to build the models, and XGBoost showed the best performance, achieving an ROC-AUC Score of 0.85. This indicates its strong capability to distinguish between efficient and inefficient NbS. We further applied explainable AI to interpret the DEA-ML model and understand the impact of inputs on efficiency at both universal and individual levels. The non-stationary effects between each input and efficiency were explored, and the possible thresholds to improve efficiency were identified accordingly. By bridging AI-driven modelling with ecosystem services science, this framework offers a replicable and transparent approach to NbS efficiency evaluation, contributing to multiple sustainable development goals. It assists decision-makers in evaluating the performance of future NbS, suggesting guidelines for improving efficiency and facilitating the creation of strategic plans aimed at effectively enhancing urban resilience.
