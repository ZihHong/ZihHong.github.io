abstract: Climate change has resulted in diverse risks to our environment. Green infrastructure has expanded and been implemented in Taiwan for climate change adaptation and mitigation. Past research on green infrastructure has emphasised its benefits but failed to discuss the costs of building them, which are important because of resource limitations. To address these research gaps, a comprehensive study that integrates co-benefits and costs should be conducted. The main concept underpinning this study is environmental efficiency, which is expected to yield higher benefits, lower costs, and greater positive impacts on the environment. Environmental efficiency is essential for achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This research is expected to develop a green infrastructure planning model based on an environmental efficiency perspective for sustainable land management. Several simulation tools and spatial analysis approaches will be applied to simulate the ecosystem services provided by green infrastructure. Spatial statistical approaches will be utilised to illustrate the synergy and trade-off relationships. Finally, data envelopment analysis (DEA), which is a popular method in efficiency assessment, will be used to integrate multi-input, multi-output indices and the synergy and trade-off relationships to build a green infrastructure planning model.
