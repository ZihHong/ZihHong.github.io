abstract: Urban green spaces (UGS) offer multiple benefits to residents, including improved air quality, heat mitigation, and enhanced opportunities for exercise. For urban planners, aside from providing sufficient UGS, ensuring equitable access to these spaces is crucial for promoting environmental justice in cities. This study uses spatially explicit machine learning methods to help planners understand how socio-economic development affects equitable access to UGS and to predict the levels of equality. We investigate the potential driving factors behind UGS equality within the Taipei metropolis from 2019 to 2023. The Gini coefficient is utilised to assess equality levels of UGS access at the village level ("Li" in the local language, representing the smallest administrative unit). Spatial lagged variables are integrated into tree-based boosting models to reflect various spatial econometric specifications, allowing comparison of their performance with traditional spatial and non-spatial regression models. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are applied to identify feature importance and explore non-linear relationships between socio-economic indicators and the calculated Gini coefficients. Results indicate that machine learning algorithms outperform traditional spatial statistical models. Furthermore, incorporating spatial lagged variables into machine learning models enhances their predictive accuracy compared to models lacking spatial consideration. The findings inform urban planners about spatial disparities in green space distribution, highlighting the need for location-specific interventions. This research supports inclusive urban green space development in Taipei, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly target 11.7, which emphasises providing universal access to safe, inclusive, and accessible green spaces.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This study applies spatial machine learning to assess and predict inequality in urban green space access across Taipei (2019â€“2023). Incorporating spatial lag variables improves model accuracy and reveals key socio-economic drivers, supporting equitable and sustainable urban planning aligned with SDG 11.7.
